## Introduction
This implementation of SFTP is mostly complete however file access control is not fully working, stream types are not
fully working and the ACCT and PASS behaviour is not fully implemented, however, it works.

## Usage
Navigate to src/main/java and run client.sh to compile and run the client and run server.sh to compile and run the server
You will need to run server.sh first then run client.sh
The retrieve and store test cases will use the test and client folders in the src/main/java directory
